# Contributing to Pebble

**Contribution is incredibly welcome.** Pebble is the open-source alternative to Minecraft: Java Edition, it's a first public beta, and the bug list is unknown by definition — every issue filed and every PR opened genuinely moves the project. You don't need permission to start: pick something broken or missing and go. This file is short on ceremony and long on the things that will actually break the game if you don't know them.

## Filing a bug

Bug reports mean the world to us. [Open an issue](https://github.com/thebriangao/pebble/issues) and include the critical bits that let us reproduce it:

1. **macOS version + Mac model/chip** (e.g. "macOS 15.2, M2 MacBook Air")
2. **Pebble version** (bottom-left of the title screen)
3. **Steps**: what you did, what happened, what you expected
4. **World context** for in-world bugs: seed, dimension, coordinates (all on the F3 overlay)
5. **Settings**: render distance, ultra graphics on/off
6. **Evidence**: screenshots/video for visual bugs; `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` for crashes; the tail of `pebble test` if the engine seems wrong (expected: `456 passed, 0 failed`)

Even better than a report is a PR with the fix — the rest of this file tells you how to make one that lands.

## Setup

```bash
xcode-select --install        # Swift toolchain (Swift 6, macOS 14+ SDK)
git clone https://github.com/thebriangao/pebble.git && cd pebble
swift build                   # debug build, ~35s clean
swift run -c release pebsmoke # the test suite — must print "456 passed, 0 failed"
./pebble install              # optional: build + install the real app
```

There is no `.xcodeproj` and there never will be — the whole workflow is SwiftPM + the `./pebble` CLI. You can still open the folder in Xcode ("Open Package") if you want an IDE; just don't commit any generated project files.

## Before you open a PR

1. `swift build -c release` — clean, **zero warnings**. The codebase is warning-free and stays that way.
2. `swift run -c release pebsmoke` (or `pebble test`) — **456/456**, from the repo root (goldens are found relative to cwd).
3. If goldens changed, your PR description must justify **every** changed value (see below).
4. Keep diffs surgical. Match the style of the file you're in — this codebase has a consistent voice (compact, comment-where-it-matters), and drive-by reformatting makes review impossible.

## The golden workflow (read this twice)

`goldens/*.json` pin the engine's behavior. Two categories:

- **Frozen reference goldens** — `atlas`, `fmath`, `items`. These are immutable reference baselines with no generator — they can **never** be regenerated. If your change breaks one, your change is wrong.
- **Native baselines** — `biome`, `terrain`, `feature`, `mesh`, `worldsim`, `entity`, `systems`. Regenerable with `PEBBLE_REGOLD=1 swift run -c release pebsmoke`, but only for *deliberate* behavior changes.

The required procedure for a behavior change:

1. Make the change. Run the suite. **Read every failure.**
2. For each failing check, explain to yourself (and in the PR) why your change moved that value. "Terrain hashes pass but feature hashes changed, consistent with my flower fix" — that level.
3. Only then regold, and re-run to confirm green.
4. Sanity-check the regold: `PEBBLE_REGOLD` rewrites whole files, and JSON key order shuffles, so byte diffs lie. Compare semantically (e.g. `python3 -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("a"))==json.load(open("b")))'`) and confirm that only the files you expected actually changed values.

Never blanket-regold to make red go green. The suite caught real bugs precisely because nobody did that.

## Conventions that are load-bearing

These are not style preferences. Violating them corrupts worlds or breaks determinism in ways the test suite will catch days later:

- **Registration order is ABI.** Blocks, items, biomes, and enchantments get their numeric ids from registration order, and those ids are in every saved world. Never insert, remove, or reorder registrations. New items/blocks are **appended at the end**, after the frozen baseline range, and baseline checks cover only that prefix (`BASE_ITEM_COUNT` in pebsmoke).
- **Sim code uses the deterministic layer only.** `detSin/detCos/detAtan2` (never `Foundation.sin` in sim paths), `RandomX`/`hash2`/`hash3` (never `Double.random` — cosmetic-only exceptions exist in app-side rendering/audio), `detRound` for half-step rounding.
- **No unordered iteration in sim decisions.** Swift `Dictionary`/`Set` iteration order is hash-seeded per process. If iteration order can affect world state, use an insertion-ordered array (see `tickingBEList`) or `.sorted()`.
- **Structure-piece RNG: draw, then check.** Builder RNG must be a pure function of (structure, piece). Draw every random value *before* any chunk-relative `b.get()` test — short-circuiting a draw on local chunk contents desyncs the stream across the chunks that rebuild the same piece. Also: `b.get()` returns **−1 outside the building chunk**; guard before casting.
- **Threading contract.** Chunks are built on the gen queue and published only via `adoptChunk` on main. AppKit/renderer state is main-thread-only. Saves go through the serial save queue. The audio render thread owns the voice list; talk to it through the inbox. One-time registration uses `let`-initialized globals (dispatch_once), not boolean guards.
- **GPU buffers the CPU rewrites per frame must be ring-buffered** (3 deep — see UICanvas, particles) or staged through blit encoders (see atlas animations). The renderer has no semaphore; it relies on the 3-drawable limit.
- **Version string** lives in one place: `PEBBLE_VERSION` (PebbleCore/Game/Saves.swift). Bump it there plus `packaging/Info.plist`.

## Testing tips

- `PEBBLE_AUTOLOAD=1 PEBBLE_NEWWORLD=12345 swift run -c release Pebble` — straight into a fresh world.
- `PEBBLE_CMD="/tp 0 120 0;/time set 1000" PEBBLE_SHOT="/tmp/shot.png@600"` — scripted screenshots.
- `PEBBLE_BOT=1` — runs the physics bot through the real input path and asserts walk/sprint/jump/fall-damage numbers.
- `PEBBLE_PHOTOBOOTH=1` (+ `PEBBLE_BOOTH_MOBS=cow,sheep` / `PEBBLE_BOOTH_BLOCKS=-`) — renders every mob/block to PNGs for visual review.
- `PEBBLE_PROF=1` — per-stage timings for load and tick.

## Scope & conduct

Pebble is **singleplayer, for now** — multiplayer is on the roadmap, but it's an architecture decision we'll make deliberately, so please open an issue to coordinate before attempting networking PRs; uncoordinated ones will likely be declined. Performance work is welcome but must keep goldens green and come with before/after numbers. Be a normal, decent person in issues and reviews; that's the whole code of conduct.
